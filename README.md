# FStarTypeclassesSandbox
This is my sandbox to play with typeclasses in FStar.

It is made public so that I can share results, bugs, and such, with the guys from F* team, whenever a single gist is not enough.

Don't expect anything serious here, but if you're curious -- which you are if you're still reading this -- then feel free to browse through this mess :)
